## Design

- The app makes use of Material UI 5 for the beautiful UI components.
- All the icons are taken from [Icons8](https://icons8.com) under its free-tier subscription and [react-icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-icons) package.

## About ReactJs

- React is a JavaScript-based UI development library. 
- Facebook and an open-source developer community run it. 
- Although React is a library rather than a language, it is widely used in web development. 
- The library first appeared in May 2013 and is now one of the most commonly used frontend libraries for web development.
- React offers various extensions for entire application architectural support, such as Flux and React Native, beyond mere UI.
